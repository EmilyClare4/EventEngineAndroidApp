# EventEngine
This Android application was the result of an assignment for a Mobile Application Development paper, run through Massey University.
It is an application for gaining inspiration for event hosting. As a Community Leader for the Girl Gone International Aarhus community,
one important role I play is hosting a monthly event for members to connect and create friendships. Sometimes it can be difficult to think 
of a new, exciting event to plan so I wanted to create an "Event Engine" where event hosts can get inspiration.

## Notes on use
- One current bug is that the category spinner doesn't populate on initial launch when database hasn't been initialised. After the initial launch of the app it works fine on any re-runs
- To see the recyclerview in action without having to add multiple events, select the 'Sport' category
- Users can add their own events to each category, or delete events

## Future development plans:
- Fix category spinner bug
- Design - create more modern spinner and make welcome page more modern with more info
