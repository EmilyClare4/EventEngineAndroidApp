# EventEngine
This Android application was the result of an assignment for a Mobile Application Development paper, run through Massey University.
It is an application for gaining inspiration for event hosting. As a Community Leader for the Girl Gone International Aarhus community,
one important role I play is hosting a monthly event for members to connect and create friendships. Sometimes it can be difficult to think 
of a new, exciting event to plan so I wanted to create an "Event Engine" where event hosts can get inspiration.

## Notes on use
- One current bug is that the category spinner doesn't populate on initial launch so the app has be re-run
- To see the recyclerview in action without having to add multiple events, select the 'Sport' category
- Users can add their own events to each category, or delete events
